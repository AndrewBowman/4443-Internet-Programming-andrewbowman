| 1 | Phpmyadmin is available at `http://your.ip.address/phpmyadmin`                                         |   15     |   15 |
| 2 | A user was created with `griffin` and your `M********` as the login credentials                        |   15     |   15 |
| 3 | A `4443` user and database was created.                                                                |   20     |   0 |
| 4 | A `users` table was created.                                                                           |   25     |   25 |
| 5 | The `users` table had the appropriate information added to it.                                         |   25     |   25 |
|   |                                                                                                        |   100    |  80 |

I can't see if a 4443 user was created because I didn't have proper permissions.
